# This is the repository to keep the AVIA lite code for deployment in a docker container on the web
# You will also need to download ANNOVAR to run pipeline in the back end, but will need to modify the executables 
# and may need to reformat the output

# You can also download the repository from https://github.com/vuonghm/docker_avia.git
# Code from that repository can directly be used in this pipeline
